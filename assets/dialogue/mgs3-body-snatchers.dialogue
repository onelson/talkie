Do you want to SAVE?

<prompt> YES/NO


Snake, have you ever seen "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"?

::[Snake]

Y...no, I haven't.


::[Para-Medic]

It's about this town where, one by one, the people disappear and are replaced by
someone else.


It keeps getting worse and worse, until finally the main character's friends and
family start getting replaced.


It turns out it was a giant plant thing producing human clones. Creepy, huh?


::[Snake]

Clones?


::[Para-Medic]

A clone is a body or cell that's genetically identical to another one.
They didn't use that term in the movie, though.


::[Snake]

(Heh) You mean a copy of a human being?


::[Para-Medic]

It's technologically feasible.

We know it's possible to do it in theory, and they've already started the
research.


One day - maybe towards the beginning of the next century - the genes of super
soldiers like you are going to be a hot commodity.


::[Snake]

Just to make copies of me?


::[Para-Medic]

Precisely.


::[Snake]

Like a thoroughbred horse?


::[Para-Medic]

Right.


::[Snake]

Huh...


::[Para-Medic]

Hmm...


::[Snake]

You know they'd never allow it.


::[Para-Medic]

Maybe... But technology changes people. We can't predict how people will think
50 years from now.


::[Snake]

Some things shouldn't be changed.


::[Para-Medic]

We're not the ones who decide that.


I think maybe the only thing we can do is to try and pass on our beliefs to our
children.


So that they won't head in the wrong direction.
